## Submission Questions

1. What part of building the project was the most difficult? Why?

    Deciding whether to prefetch and cache search results was difficult. Given the assessment's scope and small dataset, I prioritized user experience by prefetching and caching for smoother interaction. With a large or rapidly growing dataset, I'd fetch data only upon request and cache the search query.

2. Whats something new about React, or Javascript, or development in general that you learned recently?

    The demo of Devin, the AI software engineer, was quite impressive. It showcased its ability to write code, create websites and software, and learn from its mistakes. It's designed to assist human engineers and appears to be a great tool for day-to-day use. I'm curious to see its growth in the next five years.
